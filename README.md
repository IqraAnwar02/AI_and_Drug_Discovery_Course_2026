# Assignment 2: QSAR Data Curation from ChEMBL

# Selected Target
Target Name: Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)
ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL3608

EGFR is a clinically important receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cancer development and progression.

# Bioactivity Data
Bioactivity Type: IC50
Unit: Nanomolar (nM)
Number of Bioactivity Records: 160 total and 94 (Obtained after filtering valid IC50 values and SMILES entries)

# Data Curation Workflow
The workflow includes target identification, retrieval of IC50 bioactivity data from ChEMBL, filtering of missing or invalid records, preprocessing of molecular data, and saving the curated dataset in CSV format for QSAR modeling.
